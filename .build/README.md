You can place your build, test, package, publish and other script files (.cmd or .sh) anywhere you please. 
However, we recommend placing them in a folder name .build or build. 
Of course, this is just a recommendation; you are free to pick any pattern that fits your team's needs. 
In many cases, teams might already have these files in which case there is no need to bend over backwards to fit this recommendation.
