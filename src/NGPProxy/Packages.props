    Set all package versions here. 
	Microsoft.Build.CentralPackageVersions will read this file and update the version in each individual csproj file.
	Redefining PackageReference version in csproj will cause build error

    Ensure all packages are sorted alphabetically by their name
	Ensure versions are locked by wrapping them in square brackets, otherwise local or lab builds might unexpectedly upgrade.
