  If this is a Cosmos Export agent, these commands are monitored under the PCF Cosmos Export Agent (3134bf67-a6a9-405f-b334-4e5f287f7e87).
  Your Cosmos Export AgentId will be listed as an AssetGroupId under the PCF Cosmos Export Agent for monitoring purposes.
  This can be helpful when querying Kusto to look at these commands.<br/>
