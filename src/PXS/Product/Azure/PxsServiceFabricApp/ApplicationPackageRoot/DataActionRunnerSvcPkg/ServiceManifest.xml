      1. This service (and any PXS service) uses AP config files. Until we move to a new configuration system,
      they need to be flattened. The above batch file calls a powershell scrip that calls the AP IniFlatten.exe
      for each of our ini files. It will need to be parameterized at some point.
      
      2. Counters are currently just disabled pending geneva work. Logging just does trace/console logging and
      thus why the console redirection is enabled here. Also pending geneva work.
      
      3. For this service, no certificates need to be installed locally, but the code is modified to use
      AzureKeyVault in a ServiceFabric environment. This loads certs direct from AzureKeyVault instead of the
      local machine store, which works in all the cases this service needs (but might not work for other services like
      PXS that need to register a server side certificate for https.
      
      4. For #3 to work, the cluster's scaleset must be granted list/get on secrets and certificates in the respective
      (prod, ppe) PXS azure keyvault.
