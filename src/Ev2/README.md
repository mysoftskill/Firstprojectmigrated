# Complience Services Ev2 Registration and Policies
To register a new service you need to be a member of the admins, dev owners, or PM owners of your service in Service Tree. Check your [Service Tree profile](https://servicetree.msftcloudes.com/#/ServiceModel/Service/Profile/eda3dc03-5654-43a9-a6fa-468706c89c97) for more information. This enforcement is to make sure that no one else can register with your service id and to make sure that the provided service id is valid.

To register, update, or delete your service, you need to be a member of your security group specified by ownerGroupObjectId in the service object.
