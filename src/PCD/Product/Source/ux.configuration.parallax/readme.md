# What is this

This folder contains concreate implementation of contracts for Parallax configuration sections, which 
are generated from BOND files.

## How to make changes here

Follow instructions in `readme.md`, located in `ux.configuration.contracts` project.

## Caution

Do not enable auto-generation of configuration implementation at build time, because this makes Visual Studio rebuild all projects 
every time you use F5/Ctrl-F5.
