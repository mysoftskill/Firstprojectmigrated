<!-- 
  This document contains the list of stored procedures (sproc) for the service.
  Whenever a stored procedure needs to change, the version of the sproc needs to increment.
  This is important so that we do not break the service during deployment.
  If the name did not change, then the service would fail if a request to N-1 tries to access the sproc while it is being modified.
  By using a new name for every sproc change, we can avoid this issue.
  
  In order to deprecate old versions of a sproc, you must first ship the new version with the old version.
  Then in a subsequent deployment, you can change the action for the old version to "Remove".
  Once the removal has deployed, you can delete that version name from this file.

  <!-- Example removal: -->
  <sproc name="Test0.js" action="Remove" />
  <sproc name="Test1.js" action="Install" />
